# hello-world

In West Philidelphia 
Born and raised
On a playground
Is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out maxing relaxing all cool
And all shooting some B-Ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys
Who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said
"You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air
